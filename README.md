# Project-4-Code-Quiz

This web app is a Coding quiz that will ask users a series of multiple questions. Users have 100 seconds to answer all questions. 

Wrong answers will subtract from the timer by 10 seconds. The quiz ends when all questions have been answered. Your score is based off how much time you have left. Save your score to be taken to the Highscores page

Scores are saved with local storage and can be accessed again upon refreshing the page.

Viewing the highscores will interupt the current game if not finished. Highscores can be completely cleared on the view highscores page
